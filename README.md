# Participant list application

## TODO:
* Implement confirm dialog. When user presses delete, a confirmation is required.
* Change edit, save and delete buttons to font-awesome icons.
* Refactor the aforementioned components into their own.
* Style the table so that everything is well aligned.
* Make the site responsive.
* Generate 20 participants that contain randomized values.
* Put your own name into default data.
* Deploy the project.
* Write an installation guide.
* Implement reverse sorting.
* Ditch the running number id from reducers. Bad bad practice. (Maybe hash for id?)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
